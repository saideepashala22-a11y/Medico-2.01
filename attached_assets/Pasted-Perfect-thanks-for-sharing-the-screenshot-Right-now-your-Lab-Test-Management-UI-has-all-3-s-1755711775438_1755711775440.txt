Perfect ðŸ‘Œ thanks for sharing the screenshot. Right now, your **Lab Test Management** UI has all 3 steps (Registration â†’ Test Selection â†’ Results) on a single page.
You want to **separate them into different pages** and also **improve the flow**. Let me propose a refined design plan.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Improved App Flow (Multi-Page)

### 1. **Patient Registration Page** (`/register`)

* Fields: Patient ID (auto-generate), Full Name, Age, Gender, Contact
* Button: **Register & Continue**
* After saving â†’ redirect to **Test Selection Page**

---

### 2. **Test Selection Page** (`/tests`)

* Display patient details (from registration) at top
* List of available tests with cost
* Multi-select (can select more than one test)
* Show **Total Cost dynamically**
* Button: **Proceed to Enter Results**

---

### 3. **Enter Results Page** (`/results`)

* Based on selected tests â†’ dynamically show input fields
* Example:

  * CBC â†’ Hemoglobin, WBC, Platelets, RBC
  * Blood Sugar â†’ Fasting, Post-meal
  * X-Ray / MRI â†’ Upload file or notes
* Add **Doctorâ€™s Notes** text area
* Button: **Generate Report**

---

### 4. **Report Page** (`/report/:patientId`)

* Show formatted patient info + test results
* Option to **Download PDF**

---

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Improvements

* **Step Indicators** at the top (like a progress bar or breadcrumbs):
  `1. Registration â†’ 2. Test Selection â†’ 3. Results â†’ 4. Report`
* Clean card layouts for each step
* **Auto-save patient info** so that if you refresh, data isnâ€™t lost
* Add **Back button** on each page

---

## âš¡ Tech Implementation in React

* Use **React Router** to handle navigation:

  ```jsx
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/register" element={<PatientRegistration />} />
    <Route path="/tests" element={<TestSelection />} />
    <Route path="/results" element={<EnterResults />} />
    <Route path="/report/:id" element={<Report />} />
  </Routes>
  ```
* Use **Context API or Redux** to carry patient + test info across pages
* Use **jspdf** in frontend to generate PDF

---

## Example Report Output

**Hospital Name**
Patient ID: HMS-2025-002
Name: Sas | Age: 22 | Gender: Male

**Selected Tests**: CBC

**Results**:

* Hemoglobin: 12 g/dL
* WBC Count: 7500 /ÂµL
* Platelets: 250000 /ÂµL
* RBC Count: 4.5 M/ÂµL

Doctorâ€™s Notes: *Normal blood profile*

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to **create a React skeleton code with 4 pages (Registration â†’ Tests â†’ Results â†’ Report)** so you can run it on Replit right away, or should I just give you the **page-by-page React code** that you can integrate manually?
