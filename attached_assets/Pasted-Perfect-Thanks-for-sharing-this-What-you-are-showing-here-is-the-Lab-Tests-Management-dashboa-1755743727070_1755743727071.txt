Perfect 👍 Thanks for sharing this!
What you are showing here is the **Lab Tests Management dashboard**, and you want to add a feature to **create new test types with their cost**.

Here’s how we can extend the design and functionality:

---

## 🔹 New Feature: Add & Manage Lab Tests

Inside **Lab Tests** section, we can have two tabs:

1. **Available Tests**

   * Show list of all tests (Test Name, Department, Cost, Active/Inactive).
   * Example: "Blood Sugar", "CBC", "X-Ray", etc.

2. **Add New Test**

   * A form with:

     * **Test Name** (text field)
     * **Department** (dropdown – Pathology, Radiology, etc.)
     * **Cost** (numeric input with currency symbol ₹/\$/€)
     * **Description / Notes** (optional)
     * **Save** button

   ✅ When saved, the test will be available in the dropdown while registering a patient’s lab test.

## 🔹 Workflow Example

1. Admin/Lab Manager goes to **Lab Tests → Add New Test**
2. Adds "Vitamin D Test", Cost = ₹800
3. Now when a receptionist/lab staff registers a patient → they see "Vitamin D Test" in the list of available tests.

## 🔹 UI Placement (in your design screenshot)

* In **Lab Tests** card → Add a button: `➕ Add New Test`
* Clicking it opens a **popup modal or new page** with the form.
* Saved test appears in the **Available Tests Table**.

---

## 🔹 Technical Implementation (Replit App)

* **Database Table: `lab_tests`**

  ```sql
  id (PK) | test_name | department | cost | description | created_at
  ```

* **API Endpoints**

  * `POST /lab-tests` → Add new test
  * `GET /lab-tests` → Fetch all tests
  * `PUT /lab-tests/:id` → Update test
  * `DELETE /lab-tests/:id` → Remove test

* **Frontend (React/Next.js)**

  * Table to display existing tests
  * Modal form to add/update tests

👉 Do you want me to **add this “Add New Test with Cost” feature into the full app plan** I gave earlier and show you **exact UI layout** for this page (like the screenshot you uploaded)?
